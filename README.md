# CollaboratorFetcher
## Description
**CollaboratorFetcher** is a Java-based Burp Suite extension built using the `Montoya API`. It enables opening a web application API interface between Burp Suite's Collaborator and your local machine.

I developed this extension to facilitate interaction with the Collaborator server using Python scripts and tools. Since direct communication with the Collaborator is only possible through Java-based extensions, **CollaboratorFetcher** provides an easy workaround. By loading this extension in Burp Suite, you can develop your Python scripts, interact with Collaborator via a web API, and seamlessly handle HTTP and DNS responses.
